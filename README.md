# National Public Headlines

With this project, I aim to create a database, updated multiple times/day, to store page-position as well as headline text and data for each article headline data from www.npr.org and make it accessible through REST API endpoints. 

### Prerequisits for running locally:
* Node.js
* PostgreSQL

* Clone or download the zip

```npm install```
```npm start```
